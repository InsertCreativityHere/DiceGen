This file contains the instructions for converting an SVG vector image file into a mesh model that can be used in Sketchup.
There are two main phases to the process, first the vectorized curve must be cleaned and simplified in Inkscape, and then second, it's converted from a curve into a mesh in Blender.
These instructions both explain the process, and also provide the necessary key-presses/mouse-clicks to automate it.



===== INKSCAPE =====
Inkscape is used before Blender to quality check and clean up the SVG image before it can be fed through the rest of the process.
0. Import all the files as a batch. They can be opened directly from finder, so it's best to select all of them and open them together.
1. Change the editing mode from 'Object' to 'Node'. This doesn't alter the curves, but just makes it so that Inkscape will highlight the vector curves, and show the nodes that comprise it.
   Not strictly required, but it will really help you see any issues in the curve throughout the process that might need attention.
        "Edit Paths by Node"
        "N"
2. Ungroup everything: Remove the groupings so that the vector paths are all at the top level and at equal footing.
   This process may need to be repeated multiple times depending on how must nesting there is. Usually it seems like 2 is enough though.
        “Edit -> Select All” && “Object -> Ungroup”
        “<CMD> + A” && “<Shift> + <CMD> + G”
3. Convert strokes and objects to paths: In order for unioning to work correctly without altering the shape of the drawing, everything must be converted to closed raw paths first.
   This step requires visual inspection and manual conversion, and so can't be fully automated with keyboard shortcuts. Just go through the right hand column and convert any strokes
   or objects into paths (it'll probably be necessary to ungroup them afterwards afterwards, as objects will be converted into stroke+path groups). At this point, it's also good to
   delete any empty or errorneous paths, as those will interfere with the unioning process later as well. You can tell if something is empty if when it's select no anchor points or
   bounding boxes appear in the screen, or really just if nothing shows up at all.
   To delete an entity use:
        "Edit -> Delete"
        "<Backspace>"
   To convert strokes and objects into paths use:
        "Path -> Stoke to Path"
        "<Option> + <CMD> + C"
4. Ungroup everything: Remove the groupings so that the vector paths are all at the top level and at equal footing.
   This process may need to be repeated multiple times depending on how must nesting there is. Usually it seems like 2 is enough though.
        “Edit -> Select All” && “Object -> Ungroup”
        “<CMD> + A” && “<Shift> + <CMD> + G”
5. Combine the paths together into a single path: This eliminates any overlaps or intersections that Blender couldn't handle by joining everything together.
        “Path -> Union”
        “<CMD> + +”
6. Inspect the curve for any leftover irregularities that need to be fixed manually.
   This can be done with the node-editing toolbar that is at the bottom of the top menu bar. Obviously, there's no set process for this, and it's often unnecessary even.
7. Save the cleaned file: This should be self explanatory (hopefully...)
        “ File -> Save As”
        “<Shift> + <CMD> + S”
8. Close the file: also should be self explanatory, but including it's keyboard shortcut makes processing the images all the faster.
        “ File -> Close”
        “<CMD> + W”

The complete process for running an SVG image through Inkscape is:
    “N”   ->   “<CMD>  A”   ->   “<Shift>  <CMD>  G”   ->   “<Shift>  <CMD>  G”
    Delete any empty entities, and convert all strokes and objects into paths with "<Backspace>" and "<Option> + <CMD> + C" respectively
    “<CMD>   +”
    Visually inspect the final curve and it's nodes to make sure there isn't any weird paths or overlapping left. If there is, fix it obviously.
    ”<Shift>  <CMD>  S”   ->   “<CMD>  W”



===== BLENDER =====
Blender is where the brunt of the work happens. It's used to convert the vector curve into a 3d mesh that can actually be imported into Sketchup.
From a file-extension point of view, it converts an SVG file to a DAE.

When first starting up Blender there are two things you have to do before importing any curves. These changes stay in effect for as long as Blender
is open and hence only have to be done at the offset:
  • Open the "Transform" menu. this is done by pressing "N" and is necessary for step 4 where we directly set the y-dimension of the object.
  • Set the "Transform Pivot Point" to "Bounding Box Center" (or hit "B" when in the menu). The menu is located at the bottom center of the top toolbar.

Before starting on the first file, you should press "N" to bring up the 'Transform' menu. It stays open the entire time Blender is, and is necessary
for step 4 of the conversion/cleaning process.

1. Import the file: Unlike with Inkscape, files can't be directly opened from Finder, since they aren't openable by Blender, just importable.
   So the best way that I'm currently aware of is importing them into an empty Blender scene. Maybe a better way exists, who knows.
        “File -> Import -> Scalable Vector Graphics (.svg)”
        “<fn> + F4 + I + S”
   After importing, you must manually select all the curves you're going to be working with from the 'Scene Collection' pane, then making sure that nothing
   is currently selected in the "View Perspective", hit "A" to select all.
2. Move the object's origin to it's geometric center: This calculates the origin position to be the geometric center of the object. This is necessary, since
   before this, the object doesn't have a origin, which is needed for the next step and for proper exporting.
        “Object -> Set Origin -> Origin To Geometry”
        “Object -> S + O”
3. Snap the model to the global origin: This centers the object within Blender's scene, so that when it's exported, it'll be centered within Sketchup as well.
   Since the "Transform Pivot Point" is the center of the bounding box this should perfectly center the curve,
   minimizing the distance between it's most extreme points and the center of the scene.
        “Object -> Snap -> Selection to Cursor (Keep Offset)”
        “Object -> N + C”
4. Scale the model to be 8m tall: Now that the model is centered, scale it to be 8m tall, since this is the baseline that the Sketchup script expects.
   It isn't necessary but does reduce the amount of work needed when manually checking the glyph orientation on the generated dice. The 8m is derived from
   the standard height of a glyph on a D6, which is 8mm, but it's scaled up by 1000 so that Blender and Sketchup render the tiny details instead of skipping them.
   This part can't be fully automated with keyboard shortcuts unfortunately...
        Set the Y-dimension to be 8, then copy the value for the Y-scale into the X-scale to ensure it stays proportional.
        "<CMD> + A -> S" to bring up the 'Apply' menu, and apply the scaling operation.
5. Convert the curve into a mesh model: This part actually performs the conversion from a 2D vector curve into a 3D mesh model (even if the model has 0 height technically)
        “Object -> Convert To -> Mesh from Curve/Meta/Surf/Text”
        “Object -> V + M”
6. Join the meshes: This part shouldn't be necessary, since everything should of been unioned together in Inkscape, and so there should only be one mesh.
   But if there are multiple meshs, they should be combined together at this point.
        “Object -> Join”
        “<CMD> + J”
   This step should produce a warning at the bottom of the screen saying there's no meshes to join. If everything went okay in Inkscape then all the curves
   should of been unioned into a single curve, and so in Blender, there should only be a single mesh, hence the warning. This step is included just in case.
7. Save the mesh under the 'meshes' folder of the font: At this point it's customary to save a raw copy of the mesh at full resolution, since the next steps
   simplify the geometry for the sake of performance. Export it as a DAE file this way Sketchup will actually recognize and be able to import the file.
        “File -> Export -> Collada (.dae)”
        “<fn> + F4 + E + C”
8. Switch to Edit mode: This switches the display from showing the outline of the mesh model to displaying the actual mesh model itself. This isn't strictly
   necessary, but again, it helps seeing where anything might of gone wrong and needs fixing.
        “Edit Mode” && “Select -> All”
        “<TAB>” && "A"
9. Lower the poly-count: This step is technically optional, but highly recommended to improve performance in Sketchup. Often the conversion of curves to meshes
   leaves far more vertices than is necessary, so this step can remove many of these unnecessary vertices (along with their edges and faces) usually without
   affecting the overall shape much at all.
        "Modifier Properties -> Add Modifier -> Decimate" (Modifier Properties is one of the tabs in the bottom-right property pane)
   I find that the normal 'Collapse' option with a ratio of about '0.35' hits the spot, but different ratios will be needed depending on the complexity of the mesh.
   Sometimes the 'Planar' option with a degree of around 2.0 is also helpful, but usually that and 'Subdivide' are more prone to alter the mesh's macroscopic shape.
10. Beautify the meshes: This recalculates the mesh geometry to make it cleaner looking, simplifying the geomtry that Sketchup will have to import later.
        "Face -> Beautify Faces"
        "Face -> B"
11. Zoom around the model and check to make sure that everything is connected and the geometry looks solid. If necessary, translate the mesh to make it appear
    more visually centered.
12. Export the file: Now that the model is finished, export it as a DAE file into the 'finished' folder of the font.
        “File -> Export -> Collada (.dae)”
        “<fn> + F4 + E + C”
One final note when Blendering: it doesn’t remember the last folder you saved in, and navigating to the right folder takes time and introduces possibility of error,
so it’s probably worth adding a ‘Favorite' when you’re exporting the first DAE mesh, to make life easier for the other 9, just make sure to delete it after finishing.
It's also important to delete the number from the scene after words by right clicking it's container in the right-most 'Scene Collection' list and selecting
"Delete Hierarchy" or pressing "H". That's it!

The complete process for converting an SVG image to a DAE mesh with Blender is:
    “<fn>  <F4>  I  S”   ->   <Manually select the curves in the Scene Collection>   ->   “A”   ->   “[Object]  S  O”   ->   “[Object]  N  C”
    Set the Y-dimension to 8, and copy the value that appears for y-scaling into the x-scaling field.
    "<CMD>  A"   ->   "S"   -> "[Object]  V  M"   ->   "<CMD>  J"   ->   "<fn>  <F4>  E  C"    ->    "<TAB>"   ->   "A"
    Decimate the curve with "Modifier Properties -> Add Modifier -> Decimate", a good starting point is collapsing it at a 0.4 ratio.
    "[Face]  B"    ->    <Check the mesh for imperfections and make it appear visually centered>    ->    “<fn> + F4 + E + C”
    Then make sure the delete the current collection by right clicking it in the "Scene Collection" list and hitting "H"
But it's important to make sure that before you start converting any curves that you've opened the "Transform" menu with "N",
and set the "Transform Pivot Point" to "Bounding Box Center" by hitting "B" within the menu.
